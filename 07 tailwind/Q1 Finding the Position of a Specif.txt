Q1: Finding the Position of a Specific Student in a Sorted Matrix
You are given an 
𝑁
×
𝑁
N×N matrix where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order. The goal is to find the position of a specific enrolment number (target) efficiently.

Approach:
Since the matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise, we can use a staircase search algorithm to find the target in 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N) time.

Algorithm:
Start from the top-right corner of the matrix.
If the target is smaller than the current element, move left.
If the target is larger than the current element, move down.
Repeat this process until the target is found or you move out of bounds.
Time Complexity:
This approach runs in 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N), where 
𝑁
N is the size of the matrix, because in each step you either move left or down, and you can make at most 
2
𝑁
2N moves.
Here’s the code:

python
Copy code
def find_student_seat(matrix, N, target):
    # Start from the top-right corner
    row = 0
    col = N - 1
    
    while row < N and col >= 0:
        if matrix[row][col] == target:
            return (row, col)  # Student found at this position
        elif matrix[row][col] > target:
            col -= 1  # Move left
        else:
            row += 1  # Move down
    
    return "Student not found"

# Example usage
N = 4
matrix = [
    [10, 20, 30, 40],
    [15, 25, 35, 45],
    [27, 29, 37, 48],
    [32, 33, 39, 50]
]
target = 29
print(find_student_seat(matrix, N, target))
Q2: Closest Pair of Delivery Locations in a 2D Plane
You are given 
𝑛
n points (delivery locations) on a 2D plane, and the goal is to find the pair of points that are closest to each other.

Approach:
We can use Divide and Conquer to solve the problem in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn) time. The idea is similar to merge sort:

Sort the points by their x-coordinates.
Recursively divide the set of points into two halves.
Find the closest pair in the left and right halves.
Find the closest pair that lies across the dividing line (this is the tricky part).
Time Complexity:
The divide and conquer approach runs in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn), which is much faster than the brute force approach of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ).
Here’s the code for solving the closest pair problem using divide and conquer:

python
Copy code
import math

# Helper function to calculate Euclidean distance
def distance(point1, point2):
    return math.sqrt((point1[0] - point2[0])**2 + (point1[1] - point2[1])**2)

# Brute force approach for small sets of points
def brute_force(points):
    min_dist = float('inf')
    p1, p2 = None, None
    for i in range(len(points)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            dist = distance(points[i], points[j])
            if dist < min_dist:
                min_dist = dist
                p1, p2 = points[i], points[j]
    return min_dist, p1, p2

# Function to find closest distance across the dividing line
def closest_strip(points, d, mid_x):
    strip = []
    for point in points:
        if abs(point[0] - mid_x) < d:
            strip.append(point)
    
    strip.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])  # Sort by y-coordinate
    
    min_dist = d
    p1, p2 = None, None
    for i in range(len(strip)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(strip)):
            if strip[j][1] - strip[i][1] >= min_dist:
                break
            dist = distance(strip[i], strip[j])
            if dist < min_dist:
                min_dist = dist
                p1, p2 = strip[i], strip[j]
    
    return min_dist, p1, p2

# Recursive divide and conquer function
def closest_pair(points):
    if len(points) <= 3:
        return brute_force(points)
    
    mid = len(points) // 2
    mid_x = points[mid][0]
    
    d1, p1_l, p2_l = closest_pair(points[:mid])
    d2, p1_r, p2_r = closest_pair(points[mid:])
    
    if d1 < d2:
        d = d1
        p1, p2 = p1_l, p2_l
    else:
        d = d2
        p1, p2 = p1_r, p2_r
    
    d3, p1_s, p2_s = closest_strip(points, d, mid_x)
    
    if d3 < d:
        return d3, p1_s, p2_s
    else:
        return d, p1, p2

# Main function to find the closest pair
def find_closest_pair(points):
    points.sort()  # Sort points by x-coordinate
    return closest_pair(points)

# Example usage
n = 5
locations = [(2, 3), (12, 30), (40, 50), (5, 1), (12, 10)]
min_distance, loc1, loc2 = find_closest_pair(locations

Here is the C++ code for solving Q1 using the staircase search method:

Q1: Finding the Position of a Specific Student in a Sorted Matrix
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void searchMatrix(int mat[][100], int N, int target) {
    int row = 0, col = N - 1;  // Start from the top-right corner
    while (row < N && col >= 0) {
        if (mat[row][col] == target) {
            cout << "Student found at: (" << row << ", " << col << ")" << endl;
            return;
        }
        if (mat[row][col] > target) {
            col--;  // Move left
        } else {
            row++;  // Move down
        }
    }
    cout << "Student not found" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int N, target;
    cout << "Enter the size of the matrix (N): ";
    cin >> N;
    
    int mat[100][100];  // Define a matrix with a max size
    cout << "Enter the elements of the matrix:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            cin >> mat[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    cout << "Enter the target enrolment number: ";
    cin >> target;

    searchMatrix(mat, N, target);

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
We start from the top-right corner of the matrix.
If the current element is greater than the target, we move left (decrement column).
If the current element is smaller than the target, we move down (increment row).
This algorithm runs in O(N) time complexity, making it efficient for large matrices.




We'll use a divide-and-conquer approach similar to the closest pair of points problem. This is more efficient than a brute force solution, reducing the time complexity to 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log

𝑛
)
O(nlogn).
