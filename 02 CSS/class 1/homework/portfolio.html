                    <p>He completed the Combined Defense Services (C.D.S.) test to enter the Army in 1996, and the Services Selection Board in Allahabad chose him. He was one of the top 35 exam candidates, and he dropped out of college to join the Indian Military Academy. He was posted to a five-month Young Officers Course at the Infantry School in Madhya Pradesh in March 1998. After finishing his training, he was appointed as a lieutenant in the Army's 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles on December 6, 1997, at Sopore, Jammu.

                        <br><br>After finishing the training, he obtained an alpha grade and was re-inducted into his Battalion in J&K. In addition to commando training, he completed various other courses in 1999. He visited his home on vacation from the Army for the Holi holiday when he saw his closest friend and fiancée, Dimple Cheema, before he died in the Kargil war, during which the war was also discussed, to which the Captain replied, "I or So I will come after waving the tricolor or wrapping myself in the tricolor, but I will come."</p>
                        
                    <p>During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Batra ordered his men to fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed. He believed that the bullet was meant for him and not his colleague.

                        <br><br>In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at Belgaum, Karnataka. The course lasted for two months and at the end of it, he was awarded the highest grading — the Instructor's Grade.
                            Every time when he came home to Palampur on leave, he would visit the Neugal Cafe. Batra last came home on leave from the army in 1999, during the Holi festival for a few days.

The 13 JAK Rif, after completing its counter-insurgency operations tenure in Kashmir under 192 Mountain Brigade of 8 Mountain Division, received orders to proceed to Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

                        <br><br> Batra informed his parents about his movement and assured them they need not worry about him.[24][32] He would call his parents at least once in ten days. The last phone call he made was on 29 June 1999. This was the last time that Batra spoke to his mother.</p>
