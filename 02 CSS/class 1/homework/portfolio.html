            <h2 id="sub">Early life and education</h2>
            <p>Batra was born on 9 September 1974, in a small town in <a href="/wiki/Palampur" class="mw-redirect" title="Palampur">Palampur</a>, Himachal Pradesh. He was the third child of Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal Kanta Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder of twin sons, born fourteen minutes before his brother, Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: <a href="/wiki/Lava_(Ramayana)" title="Lava (Ramayana)">Luv</a> (Vikram) and 'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons of the Hindu deity <a href="/wiki/Rama" title="Rama">Rama</a>, by their mother who was a professed devotee of Rama. He had two sisters: Seema and Nutan. As a young child, Batra received his primary education under the tutelage of his mother. He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in Palampur, where he studied up to middle standard. He received his senior secondary education at Central School in Palampur.
                <br><br>  After completing his Class XII board examinations in 1992 from Central School, he attended DAV College, Chandigarh in B.Sc Medical Sciences. At college, he joined the Air Wing of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) while he was in his first year. During the Inter-State NCC Camp, he was adjudged the best NCC Air Wing cadet of Punjab Directorate in North Zone. He was selected and underwent a 40-day paratrooping training with his NCC Air Wing unit at Pinjore Airfield and Flying Club, about 35 kilometres away from Chandigarh. During the next two years in DAV, he remained a cadet of the Army Wing of NCC.In addition, he was the president of the Youth Service Club of his college.
                <br> <br>  Besides his academic endeavours, Batra also dabbled in a variety of sports at his school, which he represented at the national level during the Youth Parliamentary competitions in <a href="/wiki/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>.

                    <p>He completed the Combined Defense Services (C.D.S.) test to enter the Army in 1996, and the Services Selection Board in Allahabad chose him. He was one of the top 35 exam candidates, and he dropped out of college to join the Indian Military Academy. He was posted to a five-month Young Officers Course at the Infantry School in Madhya Pradesh in March 1998. After finishing his training, he was appointed as a lieutenant in the Army's 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles on December 6, 1997, at Sopore, Jammu.

In addition to commando training, he completed various other courses in 1999. He visited his home on vacation from the Army for the Holi holiday when he saw his closest friend and fiancée, Dimple Cheema, before he died in the Kargil war, during which the war was also discussed, to which the Captain replied, "I or So I will come after waving the tricolor or wrapping myself in the tricolor, but I will come."</p>
                        
                    <p>During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Batra ordered his men to fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed. He believed that the bullet was meant for him and not his colleague.

                        <br><br>In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at <a href="/wiki/Belgaum" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karnataka" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>.

The 13 JAK Rif, after completing its counter-insurgency operations tenure in Kashmir under 192 Mountain Brigade of 8 Mountain Division, received orders to proceed to Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The battalion's advance party under Major Yogesh Kumar Joshi had reached its destination, when on 5 June, because of the outbreak of the war, its deployment orders were changed and the battalion received orders to move to Dras.
                        
                        <br><br> Batra informed his parents about his movement and assured them they need not worry about him.[24][32] He would call his parents at least once in ten days. The last phone call he made was on 29 June 1999. This was the last time that Batra spoke to his mother.</p>
